# Machine Learning For Web Developers

I presented to web developers on how web developers can utilize machine learning. Web developers and data scientist are often at an intersection. And yet, many times I hear people say they don't know enough math to begin understanding Neural Networks and machine learning. Although it may be true that the advanced mathematics and statistics involved in machine learning cannot be learned overnight, web developers have an opportunity to at least explore machine learning using JavaScript libraries. This presentation and demonstration is aimed at how Web Dev's can start exploring machine learning with simply applications today!

For this project, I built a simple color hue predictor. The user can help train by adding to the database or the user can ask the computer to make a prediction on whether the color hue is a light or dark color.
